# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

I am really excited about getting better at web development. I can't wait to acquire the skill of designing my own ideas with effects and animations in order to achieve a good user experience. I would
appreciate the opportunity to design a web site more freely, not according to a brief. I understand
that it's just the beginning. I'm
really satisfied with the way the program works, so I can't think of anything
important for improvement. Maybe
a chance to design a responsive website?
